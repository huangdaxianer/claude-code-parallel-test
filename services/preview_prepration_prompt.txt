You are an expert DevOps engineer tasked with creating a startup script for a web project.
Your goal is to create a shell script named `run_server.sh` that starts the web server for this project.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the files in the current directory to determine the project type (e.g., Python, Node.js, static HTML).
2. Create `run_server.sh` with the following requirements:
   - It must start the server on port 3000 (or use the content of the PORT environment variable).
   - If the project is a Python script using `http.server`, modify the command to use the PORT variable or default to 3000.
   - If the project is Node.js, use `npm start` or `node server.js` ensuring it listens on the correct port.
   - If it is a static site with no server file, create a simple python http server command.
   - The script should be executable (`chmod +x run_server.sh`).
   - The script MUST output "Server started on port <PORT>" to stdout when ready.
   - Ideally, redirect other logs to `server.log`.

Do not ask for clarification. Just analyze the files and create the script.
If you cannot determine how to start the server, create a script that echoes "Error: Could not determine startup command" and exits with 1.
