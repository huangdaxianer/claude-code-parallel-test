You are an expert DevOps engineer tasked with creating a startup script for a web project.
Your goal is to create a shell script named `run_server.sh` that starts the web server for this project.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the files in the current directory to determine the project type (e.g., Python, Node.js, static HTML).
2. Create `run_server.sh` with the following requirements:
   - It must support using the content of the PORT environment variable.
   - If the project is a Python script using `http.server`, modify the command to use the PORT variable or default to 3000.
   - If the project is Node.js, use `npm start` or `node server.js` ensuring it listens on the correct port.
   - If it is a static site with no server file, create a simple python http server command.
   - The script should be executable (`chmod +x run_server.sh`).
   - The script MUST output "Server started on port <PORT>" to stdout when ready.
   - Ideally, redirect other logs to `server.log`.
   - IMPORTANT: Always use `python3` instead of `python`, and `pip3` instead of `pip` in the script. Many systems do not have `python` or `pip` symlinked.
   - For `pip3 install`, always add the `--break-system-packages` flag to avoid PEP 668 errors on externally-managed Python environments.
   - CRITICAL: The server process MUST run in the FOREGROUND (no `&` backgrounding). The parent process manager relies on the script's process lifecycle to track the server. If you background the server with `&`, the script will exit immediately and the process manager will lose track of it.
   - For Python tools like uvicorn, gunicorn, flask, streamlit, always invoke them via `python3 -m <tool>` instead of calling the bare command directly (e.g., `python3 -m uvicorn main:app` instead of `uvicorn main:app`). The bare command may not be in PATH.
   - For Flask apps with `debug=True`, change it to `debug=False` to avoid the reloader restarting the process and dropping the port temporarily.
   - Add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"` near the top of the script to ensure pip-installed tools are found.

Do not change files other than the current directory you are working on (typically the working directory should be a "xxx-preview" folder).
Do not ask for clarification. Just analyze the files and create the script.
If you cannot determine how to start the server, create a script that echoes "Error: Could not determine startup command" and exits with 1.
